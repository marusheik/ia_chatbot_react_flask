This project is an AI chatbot built with **React (frontend)** and **Flask (backend)**.  
It uses **LangChain** and **Groq** to process questions based on the content of a `.txt` file.

## 🧠 Features

- Ask questions to an AI powered by LangChain and Groq.
- Chat history is displayed with React.
- Text-based knowledge from a `.txt` file.
- Loading animation while the bot processes.

## ❗ Important

I wrote a .txt file where I included the information from my CV and my work experience, with the intention of creating a sort of virtual "me" so that recruiters viewing my resume could interact with it and ask any questions they might have about me.

But you can write a .txt file with anything you want, for example, it could contain frequently asked questions about a business.
( I didn’t upload my personalized .txt file to GitHub you’ll need to create your own )

- For this, I use the DeepSeek model: **deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b**
- You’ll need an API key, which you can get for free at:
👉 https://console.groq.com/keys

Also, in the main.py file, you’ll see a variable called template. This is the "prompt" or set of instructions we give the model to tell it how it should behave. I wrote a custom one based on the specific purpose I had in mind. You can delete it and write your own prompt that fits your needs.
